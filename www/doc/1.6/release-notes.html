    <h1>Herbie 1.6 Release Notes</h1>
  </header>

  <p>The <a href="../..">Herbie</a> developers are excited to announce
  Herbie 1.6! This release focuses on multiple precisions, new syntax,
  and higher accuracy. Our favorite features are below.</p>

  <p><b>What is Herbie?</b> Herbie automatically improves the accuracy
  of floating point expressions. This avoids the bugs, errors, and
  surprises that so often occur with floating point arithmetic.</p>

  <p><b>Join us!</b> Join the Herbie developers on the
  <a href="https://fpbench.org">FPBench</a> Slack, at the monthly
  FPBench community meetings, and at
  <a href="https://fpbench.org/talks/fptalks22.html">FPTalks 2022</a>.

  <h2>Interactive Herbie</h2>

  <h2>Sampling</h2>

  <h2>Other improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Herbie's double-precision and single-precision representations
      are implemented as plugins that automatically ship with
      Herbie's core. Not only is this design cleaner, but the builtin
      plugins now serve as examples for plugin developers.
    </li>
    <li> Constants are now represented internally as operators.
      This simplifies the plugin interface as well as Herbie's internals.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Deprecations and removals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for the Racket 7.x has been removed. Please upgrade.</li>
    <li>The <code>egg-herbie</code> support package has been merged
    into Herbie proper. This means that if you want to install Herbie
    from source, you will now need a Rust compiler.</li>
    <li>Support for complex numbers has been removed.
    Please <a href="mailto:herbie@cs.washington.edu">let us know</a>
    if you are using it. We hope to reimplement this eventually,
    but with a better architecture.</li>
    <li>The <kbd>precision:fallback</kbd> flag has been deprecated, and no
    longer does anything. Use the <code>:precision racket</code> flag instead.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Try it out!</h2>

  <p>
    We want Herbie to be more useful to scientists, engineers, and
    programmers around the world. We've got a lot of features we're
    excited to work on in the coming months. Please
